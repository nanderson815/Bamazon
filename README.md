# Bamazon - A Node.js Storefront

 ## Bamazon is a Node and MySql application that allows Customers to buy products, Managers to manage the inventory, and Supervisors to track costs and sales.

#### To begin, seed the database with the `bamazonDatabase.sql` file using MySql Workbench or similar program. This will create your _products_ and _departments_ tables in the database. All other changes to the database will be made using one of the three Node applications.
